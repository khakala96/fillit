# Fillit
This was a pair project that I did with tbergkul. In this project, we arrange tetriminos and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them. The file given to the program has a specific format : every Tetrimino must exactly fit in a
4 by 4 chars square and all Tetrimino are separated by an newline each. (and a newline at the end of file)
