# Fillit
This was a pair project that I did with tbergkul. In this project, we arrange tetriminos and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them. Basically its a sorting algorithm that sorts the given tetriminos in the smallest square possible.
## Getting started
````
1. Clone the repo on your computer.
2. Run make
3. ./fillit test_files/test1
````
### Test files
````
A valid test file:
````
The file given to the program has a specific format : every Tetrimino must exactly fit in a
4 by 4 chars square and all Tetrimino are separated by an newline each. (and a newline at the end of file)
````
Example of a valid file with valid tetriminos:
